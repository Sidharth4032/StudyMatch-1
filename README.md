# StudyMatch

StudyMatch is an online platform aiming to help students find their study partner. It is used to help students schedule study sessions together which can be hard to schedule as most students do not use LMS or Webex to communicate. In addition, asking another student during class time can be awkward and lead to a weird interaction where it can be one-sided. StudyMatch serves to match interested students in studying together for a more efficient study session.

Features:
- Scheduling
- Messaging
- Variety of Topics & Subjects
- Simple but Effective

Our Algorithm:
- Collect data about students such as their grade, subjects, availability, and proficiency levels
- We will weigh each student’s preferences and assign a score for each user
- People with the closest scores will get matched 
- Ensure schedule & availability align
- The rating system will exist more so to verify and boost or lower a student’s proficiency level. However, this will be kept private as to not leak any sensitive information about student proficiency levels. After a session, students will be able to rate each other.
